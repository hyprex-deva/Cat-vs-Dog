# Cat-vs-Dog
In this project, we are going to use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of cats and dogs. We will build and train a deep learning model using the Keras library in Python, and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.

We will be using the Cats vs Dogs dataset, which contains 12,500 images of cats and dogs respectively. The dataset is divided into 2 sets: a training set with 10,000 images, and a test set with 2,500 images.<br>
